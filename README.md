# ASSIGNMENT_6

PROBLEM 1:

we are pridicting the diabetes disease using the keras api 

from the source code we:

1.)add more Dense layers to the existing code and check how the accuracy changes.

2.)Change the data source to Breast Cancer dataset given in the source code folder and make required changes and Report accuracy of the model.

3.)Normalize the data before feeding the data to the model and check how the normalization change the accuracy of the model

PROBLEM 2:

Using Image Classification on the hand written digits data set with mnist

from the source code we:

1.)Plot the loss and accuracy for both training data and validation data using the history object in the source code.

2.)Plot one of the images in the test data, and then do inferencing to check what is the prediction of the model on that single image.

3.)We had used 2 hidden layers and Relu activation, so change the number of hidden layer and the activation to tanh.

4.)Running the same code without scaling the images and checking the result.
